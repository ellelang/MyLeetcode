    "## 7.8. Priority Queues with Binary Heaps\n",
    "In earlier sections you learned about the first-in first-out data structure called a queue. One important variation of a queue is called a priority queue. A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing it from the front. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority. The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back. Thus when you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front. We will see that the priority queue is a useful data structure for some of the graph algorithms we will study in the next chapter.\n",

    "The binary heap is interesting to study because when we diagram the heap it looks a lot like a tree, but when we implement it we use only a single list as an internal representation. The binary heap has two common variations: the min heap, in which the smallest key is always at the front, and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front. "

    "\n",
    "Another interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent it using a single list. We do not need to use nodes and references or even lists of lists. Because the tree is complete, the left child of a parent (at position p) is the node that is found in position 2p in the list. Similarly, the right child of the parent is at position 2p+1 in the list. To find the parent of any node in the tree, we can simply use Python’s integer division. Given that a node is at position n in the list, the parent is at position n/2."

The good news about appending is that it guarantees that we will maintain the complete tree property. The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure property. However, it is possible to write a method that will allow us to regain the heap structure property by comparing the newly added item with its parent. If the newly added item is less than its parent, then we can swap the item with its parent. \n",
