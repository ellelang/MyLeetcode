    "\n",
    "In previous sections we were able to make improvements in our search algorithms by taking advantage of information about where items are stored in the collection with respect to one another. For example, by knowing that a list was ordered, we could search in logarithmic time using a binary search. In this section we will attempt to go one step further by building a data structure that can be searched in O(1) time. This concept is referred to as hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later. Each position of the hash table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0. For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on. Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty. We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value `None`. Figure 4 shows a hash table of size m=11. In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __mapping between an item and the slot where that item belongs in the hash table is called the hash function__. The hash function will take any item in the collection and __return an integer in the range of slot names, between 0 and m-1__. Assume that we have the set of integer items 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31. Our first hash function, sometimes referred to as the “remainder method,” simply takes an item and divides it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value (h(item)=item%11).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the hash values have been computed, we can insert each item into the hash table at the designated position as shown in Figure 5. Note that 6 of the 11 slots are now occupied. This is referred to as the load factor, and is commonly denoted by λ, \n",
    "For this example, λ=6/11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we want to search for an item, we simply use the hash function to compute the slot name for the item and then check the hash table to see if it is present. This searching operation is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can probably already see that this technique is going to __work only if each item maps to a unique location__ in the hash table. For example, if the item 44 had been the next item in our collection, it would have a hash value of 0 (44%11==0). Since 77 also had a hash value of 0, we would have a problem. According to the hash function, two or more items would need to be in the same slot. This is referred to as a collision (it may also be called a “clash”). Clearly, collisions create a problem for the hashing technique. We will discuss them in detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a hash function that minimizes the number of collisions, is easy to compute, and evenly distributes the items in the hash table. There are a number of common ways to extend the simple remainder method. We will consider a few of them here."

    "We now return to the problem of collisions. When two items hash to the same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item in the hash table. This process is called collision resolution. As we stated earlier, if the hash function is perfect, collisions will never occur. However, since this is often not possible, collision resolution becomes a very important part of hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for resolving collisions looks into the hash table and tries to find another open slot to hold the item that caused the collision. A simple way to do this is to start at the original hash value position and then move in a sequential manner through the slots until we encounter the first slot that is empty. Note that we may need to go back to the first slot (circularly) to cover the entire hash table. This collision resolution process is referred to as open addressing in that it tries to find the next open slot or address in the hash table. By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an open addressing technique called __linear probing__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage to linear probing is the tendency for clustering; items become clustered in the table. One way to deal with clustering is to extend the linear probing technique so that instead of looking sequentially for the next open slot, we skip slots, thereby more evenly distributing the items that have caused collisions. This will potentially reduce the clustering that occurs. Figure 10 shows the items when collision resolution is done with a “plus 3” probe. This means that once a collision occurs, we will look at every third slot until we find one that is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general name for this process of looking for another slot after a collision is rehashing. \n",

Otherwise, part of the table will be unused. To ensure this, it is often suggested that the table size be a prime number. \n"

    "We now turn our attention to using a divide and conquer strategy as a way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. The first algorithm we will study is the merge sort. Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a merge, is performed. Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them together into a single, sorted, new list."
