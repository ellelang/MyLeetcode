    "## 4.2 What Are Linear Structures?\n",
    "We will begin our study of data structures by considering four simple but very powerful concepts. Stacks, queues, deques, and lists are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as linear data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end."

    "A stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called __LIFO, last-in first-out__. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal"

The ordering is typically either ascending or descending and we assume that list items have a meaningful comparison operation that is already defined. Many of the ordered list operations are the same as those of the unordered list."

The ordered list of integers given above (17, 26, 31, 54, 77, and 93) can be represented by a linked structure as shown in Figure 15. Again, the node and link structure is ideal for representing the relative positioning of the items."
